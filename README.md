*Machine Learning Applications for Analysis of Genomics Data*

Taking part in the M.Sc. Biophysics Module *Systems Biology: Computational Analysis and Interpretation of High-throughput Data* I created this respository to give an overview of the content of the 2-week practical (12/11/2024-24/11/2024) on Computational Genomics. It features three chapters of theory from the book ["Computational Genomics with R"](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/) by Altuna Alkalin (2020) as well as a [Final Report](https://github.com/olxssa/Computational_Genomics/blob/main/Final_Report.ipynb) in which the acquired knowledge was applied to real data:

1. [Statistics for Genomics](https://github.com/olxssa/Computational_Genomics/blob/main/Module1_Statistics_for_genomics.ipynb) (12/11/2024-15/11/2024)
* Statistical distributions
* Hypothesis testing
* Linear Models

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/olxssa/Computational_Genomics/blob/main/Module2_Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb) (18/11/2024-20/11/2024)
* Clustering
* Dimensionality reduction techniques
   
3. [Predictive Modeling with Supervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/olxssa/Computational_Genomics/blob/main/Module3_Supervised_Learning.ipynb) (21/11/2024-22/11/2024)
* Data pre-processing
* Classification techniques
* Regression techniques
* Model performance evaluation: cross-validation, bootstrap resampling
* Variable importance
* Regularization

4. [Final Report](https://github.com/olxssa/Computational_Genomics/blob/main/Final_Report.ipynb): *Analysis of CpG methylation data from individuals of different ages* (22/11/2024-23/11/2024)
* Background on CpG methylation influenced by age
* Data pre-processing
* Prediction techniques
* Model implementation (RF, NN, LR) and comparison of performances
* Variable importance
